                            <strong>Kazakh foods</strong> you simply have to try during a visit to <span
                                class="place">Kazakhstan</span>. They are rich in history and offer unique insight into
                            life in this vast, nomadic country.
                        </p>
                        <p>Its vast grasslands have traditionally been home to nomadic herders, so it&rsquo;s little
                            wonder that traditional Kazakh cuisine relies heavily on the meats and offal of sheep,
                            horses, goats, and occasionally cattle and camels, along with a rich variety of sweet
                            treats, often using variations of milk and dough.</p>

                        <p>By necessity, this lifestyle has also ensured that Kazakh food is both highly nutritious and
                            can be preserved for long periods of time. The list below is by no means exhaustive but
                            includes many of the timeless Kazakh dishes still popular today.</p>

                        <h3 class="numer_dish_name"> 1 <span class="dish">Bylamyq</span> - Grain porridge</h3>



                        <p>Traditionally served to new mothers, the sick or the elderly, this hearty grain porridge is
                            made from wheat or millet flour, fried with animal fat to a golden brown, and then simmered
                            in cow&rsquo;s milk and seasoned with sugar and salt.</p>



                        <p>This staple of Kazakh breakfasts digests easily, and is packed with a host of nutritious
                            ingredients, including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibers, B vitamins, and minerals.</p>



                        <p><span class="dish">Bylamyq</span> was also one of the go-to meals during the Kazakh famine of
                            the early 20th century.</p>

                        <p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the famines of yesteryears in <span
                                class="place">Kazakhstan</span> are the main reason this simple and nourishing dish came
                            into existence, and while some argue it&rsquo;s a dish for the young or the elderly, Kazakhs
                            of all ages to this day enjoy <span class="dish">Talqan</span>.</p>



                        <p>Rich and comforting, this is a Kazakh treat to be eaten either in the morning or as a sweet
                            afternoon snack.</p>

                        <p><span class="dish">Baursaq</span> is made from a dough of flour and eggs, which is
                            deep-fried, cut into bite-size pieces, and served with sugar, butter, honey or jam. It is
                            often dipped in tea, and it is one of the country&rsquo;s most popular treats.</p>

                            along with fermented horse milk and camel milk, represent purity to Kazakhs, and are
                            considered sacred.</p>

                        <p>Not only that, but this beverage is a refreshing and healthy way to quench your thirst on a
