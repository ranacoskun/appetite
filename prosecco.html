                            In recent weeks, the winemakers have been scrambling to nail down a final proposal to
                            the Italian government
                            before a year-end deadline. The producers hope to be eligible for a
                            streamlined European Union system that goes into effect in August. If all goes well,
                            the new <span class="drink"><a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco">prosecco</a></span> protections
                            will be in place for the 2009 harvest.

                        <p>
                            But that is just a start. European Union regulations are valid only for members, and
                            deals have to be struck with countries outside of the union, like the <span class="place"><a
