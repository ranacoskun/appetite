                        <p class="drop-cap">The name “<span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a>:</span>” is a combination of just
                            two words, "besh" and "barmak" which translate as “five” and “fingers,” respectively.
                            Combined, it describes the traditional way in which the meal is eaten: with the hands. This
                            and the simplicity of
                            <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a>:</span> both speak to the long history of mobile pastoralism
                            practiced throughout the region, lives spent on the move between seasonal grazing grounds,
                            and the peoples dependence upon their animals for sustenance.
                        </p>

                        <p>Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and most other major languages of <span class="place">Central Asia</span> are
                            <span class="concept">Turkic</span> in origin. The dish is thus known by similar names
                            across the cultures that traditionally eat the dish. For example, the number five in Kazakh
                            "bes" and the meal is sometimes, though not typically, called <span
                                class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a>:</span>. The “қ” at the end of the word is unique to the Kazakh
                            alphabet. In Uzbek and Kyrgyz, the number five is “besh” and the dish is thus called <span
                                class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a>:</span>. In the Bashkir and Tatar languages, one would eat <span
                                class="dish">bishbarmak:</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="place">Central Asia</span> also occupied a prominent role along the <span
                                class="concept">Silk Road</span>. In the Chinese region of <span
                                class="place">Xinjiang</span>, which today boasts a large ethnic Kazakh population,
                            <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> is called "<span class="dish">naryn</span>" in Chinese.
                            <span class="dish">Naryn</span> refers to a city, river, and region in <span
                                class="place">Kyrgyzstan</span>. It was also the original name of the food, before
                            “<span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span>” was first applied to the food during the <span
                                class="concept">Soviet era</span>. The new name was originally something of a joke,
                            however, it soon stuck and became the standard. The original, however, <span
                                class="dish">naryn</span>, perhaps best reflects the ancient and deep roots that this
                            food has within <span class="place">Central Asian</span> cultures, as it is a name that
                            connects it the food to the wider land and identity of the people.
                        </p>

                        <p>Lastly, while these are the most common names one would encounter on a trip abroad, some
                            traditionalists, particularly in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span>, will say that

                            to be eaten. They instead call it simply
                            “yet” which translates to simply “meat.”</p>

                        <p>While <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> is a delicious meal to eat anytime, most people
                            will tell you that it is difficult to prepare in small portions. <span
                                class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> is typically cooked for large gatherings and served
                            family style on platters placed in the center of the table. As a staple of their culture,
                            <span class="place">Central Asians</span> are quite hospitable people and take great pride
                            in their history and traditions. It is not uncommon for guests to be served first with the
                            best cuts of meat though in their absence, this honor is reserved for the eldest in
                            attendance. If you are lucky enough to partake in meal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a> and find yourself
                            squeamish about using your hands to eat, fret not, utensils are a perfectly acceptable
                            alternative though at least an attempt to eat with your five fingers will surely elicit a
                            great deal of respect from those at the table.

                        <p>For those who find themselves in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span> without a local chef,
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a> can be ordered at restaurants specializing in traditional cuisine.

                        <h2>Preparing Traditional <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span></h2>

                        <p><span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> can be prepared in a number of ways depending on the
                            type of meat one would like to include in the dish. The most traditional form of the meal is
                            cooked using horse meat, although beef and lamb are common substitutions. Pork and chicken
                            are not recommended. For those looking to go truly authentic, horse meat sausage called
                            "<span class="dish">qazy</span>" is cooked along with the other cuts.</p>

                        <p>Outside of <span class="place">Central Asia</span> horse meat can be difficult to come by. In
                            fact, some western countries have banned the sale and consumption of horse meat altogether.
                            During the <span class="event">2012 Olympics</span> in <span class="place">London</span>,
                            the Kazakh national team had to petition the <span class="concept">UK government</span> to
                            allow them to bring <span class="dish">qazy</span> with them, arguing that it kept them fit
                            and healthy for competition. In addition to beef and lamb, <span
                                class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> in western <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span>, where
                            people have access to the <span class="place">Caspian Sea</span>, is often prepared using
                            fish. Sturgeon is preferred but salmon and trout are also acceptable.</p>

                        <p>In addition to meat substitutions, the dish can be altered slightly with additional
                            vegetables. Popular choices include carrots and potatoes.</p>

                        <p>The only other aspect of preparing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a> that requires mention here is the noodles.
                            Whether one chooses homemade or store-bought is entirely a personal preference, they should
                            be square or rectangular in shape to allow for easy grabbing - the recipe below calls for
                            diamond shapes. If you happen to be in <span class="place">Kazakhstan's Kyzylorda
                                region</span>, though, expect to find your <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> meat
                            resting upon a bed of rice rather than noodles, a regional variation that exists due to the
                            abundance of that grain in that area. Other regional variations tend to be almost
                            indiscernible to those without deep knowledge of the food. For instance, the difference
                            between Kazakh and Kyrgyz <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span> is really only that you are
                            more likely to find the onion sauce a bit thicker in <span class="place">Kyrgyzstan</span>
                            than you would in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span>.</p>

                        <p>However one chooses to prepare <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span>, the most important thing
                            to keep in mind is to make a lot and invite friends and family with whom to feast. Never
                            fear making too much, either. The largest serving of <span class="dish"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beshbarmak">beshbarmak</a></span>,
                            prepared in <span class="place">Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan</span> in 2018, weighed in at just over
                            3,200 lbs. - and all of it was eaten!</p>
