                        <p><span class="dish">Beshbarmak:</span> is a dish enjoyed throughout <span class="place">Central Asia</span> as well as regions of <span class="place">Russia</span> and <span class="place">China</span>. It consists of boiled meat served on a bed of thick, flat noodles and covered in an onion sauce called <span class="dish">tuzdyk</span>. A meal both hearty and delicious, 
                            <span class="dish">beshbarmak:</span> is particularly popular in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span> and <span class="place">Kyrgyzstan</span> where it holds the privileged position of a national dish. It requires but a few ingredients to prepare, typically feeds an entire party, and, depending on how traditional one wants to be, does not even require eating utensils!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-body ">
                        <h2>How <span class="dish">Beshbarmak:</span> Got Its Name</h2>
                        <p class="drop-cap">The name “<span class="dish">beshbarmak:</span>” is a combination of just two words, "besh" and "barmak" which translate as “five” and “fingers,” respectively. Combined, it describes the traditional way in which the meal is eaten: with the hands. This and the simplicity of
                        <span class="dish">beshbarmak:</span> both speak to the long history of mobile pastoralism practiced throughout the region, lives spent on the move between seasonal grazing grounds, and the peoples dependence upon their animals for sustenance.</p>
                        
                        <p>Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and most other major languages of <span class="place">Central Asia</span> are <span class="concept">Turkic</span> in origin. The dish is thus known by similar names across the cultures that traditionally eat the dish. For example, the number five in Kazakh "bes" and the meal is sometimes, though not typically, called <span class="dish">beshbarmak:</span>. The “қ” at the end of the word is unique to the Kazakh alphabet. In Uzbek and Kyrgyz, the number five is “besh” and the dish is thus called <span class="dish">beshbarmak:</span>. In the Bashkir and Tatar languages, one would eat <span class="dish">bishbarmak:</span>.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="place">Central Asia</span> also occupied a prominent role along the <span class="concept">Silk Road</span>. In the Chinese region of <span class="place">Xinjiang</span>, which today boasts a large ethnic Kazakh population, <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> is called "<span class="dish">naryn</span>" in Chinese. <span class="dish">Naryn</span> refers to a city, river, and region in <span class="place">Kyrgyzstan</span>. It was also the original name of the food, before “<span class="dish">beshbarmak</span>” was first applied to the food during the <span class="concept">Soviet era</span>. The new name was originally something of a joke, however, it soon stuck and became the standard. The original, however, <span class="dish">naryn</span>, perhaps best reflects the ancient and deep roots that this food has within <span class="place">Central Asian</span> cultures, as it is a name that connects it the food to the wider land and identity of the people.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, while these are the most common names one would encounter on a trip abroad, some traditionalists, particularly in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span>, will say that beshbarmak is not actually the name of the dish but only the style in which it is intended to be eaten. They instead call it simply
                        “yet” which translates to simply “meat.”</p>

                        <h2>How and When <span class="dish">Beshbarmak</span> Is Eaten</h2>

                        <p>While <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> is a delicious meal to eat anytime, most people will tell you that it is difficult to prepare in small portions. <span class="dish">Beshbarmak</span> is typically cooked for large gatherings and served family style on platters placed in the center of the table. As a staple of their culture, <span class="place">Central Asians</span> are quite hospitable people and take great pride in their history and traditions. It is not uncommon for guests to be served first with the best cuts of meat though in their absence, this honor is reserved for the eldest in attendance. If you are lucky enough to partake in meal of beshbarmak and find yourself squeamish about using your hands to eat, fret not, utensils are a perfectly acceptable alternative though at least an attempt to eat with your five fingers will surely elicit a great deal of respect from those at the table.

                        <p>For those who find themselves in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span> without a local chef, beshbarmak can be ordered at restaurants specializing in traditional cuisine.

                            <h2>Preparing Traditional <span class="dish">Beshbarmak</span></h2>

                        <p><span class="dish">Beshbarmak</span> can be prepared in a number of ways depending on the type of meat one would like to include in the dish. The most traditional form of the meal is cooked using horse meat, although beef and lamb are common substitutions. Pork and chicken are not recommended. For those looking to go truly authentic, horse meat sausage called "<span class="dish">qazy</span>" is cooked along with the other cuts.</p>
                        
                        <p>Outside of <span class="place">Central Asia</span> horse meat can be difficult to come by. In fact, some western countries have banned the sale and consumption of horse meat altogether. During the <span class="event">2012 Olympics</span> in <span class="place">London</span>, the Kazakh national team had to petition the <span class="concept">UK government</span> to allow them to bring <span class="dish">qazy</span> with them, arguing that it kept them fit and healthy for competition. In addition to beef and lamb, <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> in western <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span>, where people have access to the <span class="place">Caspian Sea</span>, is often prepared using fish. Sturgeon is preferred but salmon and trout are also acceptable.</p>
                       
                        <p>In addition to meat substitutions, the dish can be altered slightly with additional vegetables. Popular choices include carrots and potatoes.</p>

                        <p>The only other aspect of preparing beshbarmak that requires mention here is the noodles. Whether one chooses homemade or store-bought is entirely a personal preference, they should be square or rectangular in shape to allow for easy grabbing - the recipe below calls for diamond shapes. If you happen to be in <span class="place">Kazakhstan's Kyzylorda region</span>, though, expect to find your <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> meat resting upon a bed of rice rather than noodles, a regional variation that exists due to the abundance of that grain in that area. Other regional variations tend to be almost indiscernible to those without deep knowledge of the food. For instance, the difference between Kazakh and Kyrgyz <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> is really only that you are more likely to find the onion sauce a bit thicker in <span class="place">Kyrgyzstan</span> than you would in <span class="place">Kazakhstan</span>.</p>

                        <p>However one chooses to prepare <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span>, the most important thing to keep in mind is to make a lot and invite friends and family with whom to feast. Never fear making too much, either. The largest serving of <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span>, prepared in <span class="place">Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan</span> in 2018, weighed in at just over 3,200 lbs. - and all of it was eaten!</p>

                            <li>3 eggs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Broth</h3>

                        <ul>
                        <li>Wash the meat with cold water, cut it 3-4 roughly equal parts.</li>
                        <li>Place the meat in a large saucepan, pour in cold water (4-4.5 L). Bring to a boil over high heat. When the broth is bubbling, reduce the flame to low and cook for 3-4 hours.</li>
                        <li>Remove foam as it appears. Take out the melted fat with a spoon and pour into a separate container.</li>
                        <li>After 2-3 hours, add salt to the broth, add pepper and bay leaves.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Dough for noodles</h3>

                        <ul>

                         <li>Place flour in a bowl</li>
                        <li>Beat the eggs separately, beat with a fork, as for an omelet, and add to the flour.</li>
                        <li>Add broth little by little and knead the dough with a spoon. When it becomes thick enough (dense), start working with your hands.</li>
                        <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and leave for a while.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <h3><span class="dish">Beshbarmak</span>: the final step</h3>

                       <ul>
                       <li>Remove the meat from the broth. Divide it by the fibers (by hand) into small pieces.</li>
                       <li>Cut the onion not too thick - in half rings. Fry until lightly golden in a skillet using the fat skimmed from the broth. Place the cooked onions on a plate.</li>
                       <li>Roll out the dough very thinly. Cut it into strips 5 cm wide (approximately 2 inches). Divide each into diamonds. Sprinkle them with flour so that they don't stick together.</li>
                       <li>Take about a liter of broth in a separate saucepan, bring to a boil and boil the dough pieces for one minute.</li>
                       <li>Place the diamonds in the skillet with fat.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <p>Serve <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> on a shared wide platter or high-sided tray. Put boiled dough down, slices of meat on it, and onion on top. Serve the cooked broth separately. Eat while the <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> is warm.</p>





                        <p>While <span class="dish">beshbarmak</span> is a delicious meal to eat anytime, most people will tell you that it is difficult to prepare in small portions. Beshbarmak is typically cooked for large gatherings and served family style on platters placed in the center of the table. As a staple of their culture, Central Asians are quite hospitable people and take great pride in their history and traditions. It is not uncommon for guests to be served first with the best cuts of meat though in their absence, this honor is reserved for the eldest in attendance. If you are lucky enough to partake in meal of beshbarmak and find yourself squeamish about using your hands to eat, fret not, utensils are a perfectly acceptable alternative though at least an attempt to eat with your five fingers will surely elicit a great deal of respect from those at the table.</p>
 
                        <p>For those who find themselves in Kazakhstan without a local chef, beshbarmak can be ordered at restaurants specializing in traditional cuisine.</p>
