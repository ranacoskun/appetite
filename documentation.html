                                        <p> As three individuals with diverse tastes in food, we've established a
                                            magazine
                                            named
                                            "APPETITE" for fellow food enthusiasts who share our passion for exploring
                                            various
                                            cuisines. The name, which is quite self explanatory, is to underline the
                                            hunger

                                            <p>The Baroque period, which spanned the 17th to 18th centuries, originated
                                                in
                                                Italy
                                                as a reaction to the Mannerism that dominated the late Italian
                                                Renaissance.
                                                The
                                                term "baroque" is derived from the Portuguese word for "oddly shaped
                                                pearl"
                                                and
                                                was initially used derogatorily. It has since been widely used to
                                                describe
                                                the
                                                period, known for its exuberance, theatricality, and emotional
                                                expression.

                                            <p>The Baroque era encompassed various art forms, including painting,

                                                architecture, decorative arts, and music. It was characterized by
                                                dramatic
                                                and
                                                emotional artistic expressions, and it was embraced by countries
                                                absorbed in
                                                the
                                                Counter-Reformation, particularly the Roman Catholic Church. </p>
                                            <p>The period's most notable practitioners were artists such as Annibale
                                                Carracci,
                                                Caravaggio, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, as well as composers like Claudio
                                                Monteverdi, Johann Sebastian Bach, and George Frideric Handel. The

                                                period was a response to the idealism of the Renaissance and the forced

                                                of Mannerism, and it was encouraged by the Catholic Church and absolute
                                                monarchies in Europe to communicate religious themes and glorify their

                                                included:
                                                <br>- Little or no bracketing on serifs, which are the curved

                                                between a stem and a serif.
                                                <br>- Ornate borders and typographical elements were common, in line

                                                        <p>During the Baroque period, certain books were printed with

                                                derived
                                                from Cubism. Everything from flowers to the human form became angular.

                                                became bolder and simpler as geometry took over. Subjects that were

                                                the symbols of Art Deco. The sunburst with its clearly defined circle

                                                by radiating lines is one of them; the ziggurat is another, as is the

                                                fountain motif with its arc-shapes.

                                            <p>During the Art Deco period, the margins in printed magazines' texts were
                                                often
                                                well-defined but not strictly standardized. The design ethos of Art Deco
                                                favored

                                                between text and empty space on the page.

                                                layouts of earlier periods. Instead, a more streamlined approach was
                                                adopted,
                                                with clean lines and geometric shapes influencing the design. While the

                                                were not excessively wide, they provided a sufficient buffer around the

                                                contributing to a visually pleasing and organized composition.</p>

                                            <p>Pop art emerged as an art movement during the 1950s in America and
                                                Britain,
                                                reaching its peak in the 1960s. It began as a revolt against the
                                                dominant
                                                approaches to art and culture, with young artists feeling that the art
                                                taught in
                                                schools and exhibited in museums did not represent the reality of the
                                                world
                                                around them. As a result, they turned to sources such as Hollywood
                                                movies,
                                                advertising, product packaging, pop music, and comic books for their
                                                imagery.
                                                The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by
                                                including
                                                imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books,
                                                and
                                                mundane mass-produced objects. Pop art aimed to use images of popular
                                                culture in
                                                art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most

                                            <p>While Lichtenstein successfully employed capital letters for every word
                                                in
                                                his
                                                paintings where small texts were used, we have chosen not to continue
                                                this
                                                practice. This decision is driven by the fact that our texts are
                                                significantly
                                                longer, and we want to optimize the user experience (UX).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Inspired by Lichtenstein's frequent depiction of women in his paintings,
                                                we
                                                incorporated visual elements showcasing women on our website.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>As for the color palette, again taking into account user experience (UX),
                                                we
                                                expanded it beyond primary colors, drawing inspiration from influential
                                                artists
                                                who share a similar style, like Tadanori Yokoo.
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="py-5 mb-1" id="banksy">
                                            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Banksy</h3>
                                            <p>This style is inspired by stencil street art that is following Banksy
                                                artist. Banksy is one of the brightest figures in modern art since
                                                1980s. His art is famous for reflecting problems in the world and
                                                society. </p>

                                            <p>Most of his works are quite dark so we tried to recreate his vibe by
                                                using the fonts that resemble stencil art style and use main colours of
                                                his works: black, red and grey. Also, we trying to mimic one of his
                                                murals by placing concrete textures on the background. </p>

                                            <p>Hence Banksy is a modern artist we decided to implement best practices of
                                                web design for our layout that are widely used nowadays.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Stencil art is one of humanity’s oldest creative forms. Some of our
                                                species’ first artists used stencil art techniques when they placed
                                                their hands on cave walls and blew ground minerals over them, coating
                                                the rock in blooms of red or black pigment and leaving behindtheir
                                                ghostly palmprints.</p>

                                            <p>Fast-forward some 30,000 years and stencil art techniques remain
                                                essentially unchanged. Using a sheet of cardboard, plastic, or metal
                                                with a pattern or letters cut out is surprisingly versatile, allowing
                                                craftspeople to color cloth, illustrate manuscripts, print t-shirts, and
                                                create some fantastic street art.</p>
